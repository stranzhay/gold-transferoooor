this is as is, i will not be making any more changes to this. most of this was yoinked from coral-xyz tests inside soulbound repo. can probably combine the transactions to send all at once, i was uncommenting/commenting as i figured it out. fill in pubkeys for from and to nft for the wall u want to transfer gold from/to. fromUser is your own pubkey. and then yeet a keypair path in there of where your lads are. `npm install` then `node index.js` to run. not in typescript because i hate typescript
